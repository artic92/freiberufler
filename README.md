# Why this repo?

I started my life as freiberufler, freelancer, selbst√§ndig, in June 2023 and have come across many resources since then.
I find myself constantly giving advice to other freelancers in Germany and hence thought of compiling all the info I have in a github repo, so that its easily discovered by others as well.

Feel free to contribute to this repo with resources you are aware of via a pull request and I will merge it if appropriate.
